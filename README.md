# Sakata Index

The Sakata Index is a financial indicator described in the code documentation. Here's an explanation of its results:

- **date**: This likely refers to the specific date for each data entry.
- **predicted**: A value generated by a neural network model that attempts to predict the opening value of the Nikkei 225 ETF.
- **actual**: The actual opening value of the Nikkei 225 ETF, which serves as the target or "teacher signal" for the neural network's predictions.
- **difference**: Calculated by subtracting the predicted value from the actual value.
- **accumulator**: A running total of the daily differences.

The Sakata index itself is normalized based on the most recent accumulator value for each period. Trading signals are generated based on the Sakata index values:
- A **strong buy** signal is indicated as the Sakata index approaches 0.
- Conversely, a **strong sell** signal is indicated as it approaches 100.

The important aspect of the Sakata index is not bringing 'predicted' close to 'actual', but accumulating the difference obtained by subtracting 'predicted' from 'actual'. When this accumulated error reaches a certain threshold, it triggers a strong trading signal.  

# A Custom Implementation of a Simple Neural Network

This section outlines the configuration of a simple neural network used to calculate the Sakata Index:

- **Loss function**: Uses the least-squares method to measure the difference between the predicted and actual values.
- **Activation function**: Employs the sigmoid function, which maps any input into a value between 0 and 1.
- **Learning rate**: Set at 0.5, which determines how much the weights are updated during training.
- **Weight**: Initially set at 0.5.
- **Biases**: Starts with a bias of -1 for the nodes.
- **Epoch**: The number of iterations for which the neural network will be trained, set at 500,000.
- **Layer configuration**: The neural network has three layers with the following number of nodes: [3 (Input), 4 (Hidden), 1 (Output)]. All layers except the Output layer include biases.
- **Training data**: The same dataset is used for both training and testing the model.

# Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. **Install prerequisites**:
   - Python 3
   - Node.js 16
   - MinGW-w64 (optional): For users who want to use GCC with MinGW.  
      [This link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) is provided for setting up MinGW. However, due to an error with "The file has been downloaded incorrectly!" [another link](https://winlibs.com/) is recommended 
   - brain.js (optional): A GPU accelerated library for Neural Networks written in JavaScript.

2. **Install packages**:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Python dependencies.
   - `npm install --omit=dev` to install Node.js dependencies without the development packages.

3. **Run scripts**:
   - `npm run cooking` to presumably prepare the data.
   - `npm run main+add` to run main.js and append the results.
   - `npm run plot-single` to visualize the results.

4. **If you succeed optional install, you can try this**
   - `npm run O2+add` to run cdevice.c and append the results.
   - `npm run sakata` to run braindevide.js which depend on brain.js.

# Note

Despite its vulnerabilities, the matrix multiplication (dot) function of math.js@6.6.5 is used because of its high speed. For the same reason, Node.js 16 is recommended.
