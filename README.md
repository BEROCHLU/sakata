# sakata
sakata index is accumulator of difference value between actual and predict calculated by neural network.
# neural network
This is very simple and out of date neural network program.  
* Loss function is `least-squares method`
* Activation function is `sigmoid`
* Learning rate is fixed 0.5
* Weight is fixed 0.5
* Bias is fixed -1
* [Input, Hidden, Output] layer is [3, 4, 1] and these which except Output layer include biases.
* Training data is the same Test data.
* Epoch is 500 thousand.
